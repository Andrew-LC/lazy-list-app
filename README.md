## Lazy List Todo App

![](./public/banner.png)

This is a project to implement and learn solid JS by creating a simple todo app.

The technologies used in this application are:
- Solid JS
- Supabase
- Typescript


The app has three main pages:
- Main Box or the Inbox (Store all your tasks or todos)
- Finished Page (Glance over completed tasks before cleaning them up)
- Progress page (View stats about the tasks and its completion)


## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
